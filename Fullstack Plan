🧩 Project Architecture Overview
🖥️ Frontend: React
Main views/components to build:

Game Selection View
         List of upcoming games pulled from the sports API
         Allow users to click and choose a winner (home or away)
Prediction Submission
         Button to submit prediction (e.g., Submit Prediction)
         Optional: Let users add reasoning/comments
Historical Results
         Table or card view of past games with:
                  Team names
                  Final score
                  Prediction result (win/loss)
                  Accuracy metric if the user had predicted
Leaderboard
         Ranks users based on prediction accuracy
         Use cards or a table sorted by highest score/accuracy
Social Features
         User handles, recent predictions, reactions (like/thumbs up)
         You can mock this with a small comment/reply feature

⚙️ Backend: Flask or Express.js
Build endpoints like:
GET  /api/games/upcoming         # returns upcoming games
POST /api/predictions            # submits a user's prediction
GET  /api/results/historical     # returns past game results
GET  /api/leaderboard            # returns leaderboard stats
Data flow:
Store predictions and game outcomes in MongoDB, PostgreSQL, or SQLite
Fetch updated game results from a sports API and store for future analysis

📡 API Integration
Free sports APIs to consider:
         TheSportsDB
         API-Fotball (RapidAPI)
         Sportsdata.io (NFL specific)

Example with fetch (frontend):
fetch('https://api.sportsdata.io/v3/nfl/scores/json/Schedules/2024REG', {
  headers: { 'Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key': 'YOUR_API_KEY' }
})
  .then(res => res.json())
  .then(data => console.log(data));

🧠 Machine Learning Integration
You can expose your prediction model via a Flask API endpoint like:\@app.route('/predict', methods=['POST'])
def predict():
    data = request.get_json()
    features = extract_features(data)
    prediction = model.predict([features])
    return jsonify({'prediction': int(prediction[0])})

📦 Step-by-Step Breakdown
1. ✅ Prediction Model
  It takes in game stats and returns Win/Loss
  It's in Python with scikit-learn
  Right now, it's local and not connected to the web
2. 🔓 Expose the Model as an API (Flask)
  Wrap the model in a Flask server
  Becomes a live endpoint like POST/predict
3. 🧠 Connect the Backend to Frontend
  React app lets a user pick a game
  Triggers a request to the backend
4. 💾 Store Data in a Database
  When a user makes a prediction:
    Save it in the database (e.g., MongoDB, SQLite, PostgreSQL)
    Later update with the actual result once the game is over
  Tables you'd need:
    users — name, ID, total score
    games — date, teams, actual result
    predictions — user ID, game ID, prediction, correct?
5. 🧑‍💻 Build the Frontend with React
Pages:
  Home: List of upcoming games
  Prediction Page: Select winner → Submit
  Results Page: Shows past games and whether your prediction was right
  Leaderboard: Based on how many predictions you got right
